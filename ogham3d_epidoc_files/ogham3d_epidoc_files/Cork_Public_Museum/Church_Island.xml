                    digitise and record in 3d as many as possible of the approximately four hundred surviving Ogham stones and to make
                    these 3D models freely available on the <orgName>Dublin Institute for Advanced
                        Studies</orgName> website as part of a multi-disciplinary archive of Ogham
                    stones. </p>

                        regrading which side of the arris/stemline was to be carved (V/T). The second V is followed by two notches (O) then a lighly carved X with two further notches 
                        (positioned unusually on the face beside the arris rather than on the arris) on top of the X, presumably by way of correction. The four notches in total are so spaced 
                        that they could read E, which is one of the values of X. The last two letters are clearly SS.

                                    The faint score-like mark opposite the first score of the first V may reflect this hesitation. This would make RITTECC the name in the gen. that was actually intended, which could be 
                                    taken as an Early Old Irish form of Primitive Irish *<hi rend="italic">Ritavicas</hi> 
                        (cp. <ref target="search.php?ciic=211">CIIC 211</ref>. RITTAVVECC (Kilcoolaght East) and CIIC 250. RITTAVVECAS (Corkaboy) found in two neighbouring baronies). Furthermore, a later form of this name survives in the name of the Barony, Iveragh 
                                    (<hi rend="italic">Íbh Ráthach</hi>), in which this stone was found. Similar confusion by the lapidary at the turn of the stone is to be found on the famous 
                                    <ref target="search.php?ciic=145">Arraglen stone</ref>. 
                                    Indecision may have also led to the ambiguity between the second V and the first S. As McManus suggests, he may have begun carving E, with two of the four notches, then 
                                    changed his mind and decided to use X instead but, since X can have the <rs type="character">vocalic value</rs> E or consonantal value C, he reverted back to his original plan by placing two further notches on top of the 
                                    X in an attempt to ensure that E would be read.

                        There is no doubt that the form, like RITTECC (if this is the correct interpretation), is post syncope, suggesting a date in the
