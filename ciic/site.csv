MSS 14907, fol. 184) published by Owen (Owen/1896).  Morris states: `In the ruins of Capel Angelog, in the parish of Aberdaron, in Lleyn... Some call it Capel-y-Verach neu [or] [CISP _sic_] Aberâch---Capel Berach... ' (Owen/1896, 138).

The chapel is possibly the same site as mentioned in Gough's _Camden_ cited by Huebner: `In _Capel Yverack_ in _Aberdaron, Caernarvonshire,_ cippium inscriptum extare, cuius tamen titulum non adscripsit, affirmat_. Gough's _Camden_ 3, p. 186' (Huebner/1876, 50).

Westwood/1859, 53, `Mr Wynne states that they were brought from a small farm on his estate, called Gors, between Cefn Amwlch and Aberdaron, and that they stood in what is supposed to have been the burial-ground of an old church, the site of which is still discernible [CISP _sic_].  About fifteen years ago the tenant was going to bring the spot into cultivation, and the stones were then removed, for safety, to their present resting-place.  Mr. Wynne conjectures that this church may not improbably have been one of a chain of similar buildings which were erected along the ancient route to Bardsey from Bangor, through Caernarvon, Clynnog, Llanaelhaiarn, &c.  This supposition appears well founded, for either the stones may have been primarily erected and inscribed there, or may have been brought thither from Bardsey itself after the dissolution of the monastery.  The line of the road for pilgrims to the Isle of Saints went most probably through Nevin and Tudweiliog; but whether it thence proceeded through Meyllteyrn, Bryncroes, and Aberdaron, to the eastward of Mynydd Cefn Amwlch and Rhos Hirwaen, or else to the westward of those hills, by the sea-coast, through Llangwnadl and Bodferin to Eglwys Fair, at the extreme point of the promontory, is not quite certain.  The farm of Gors (_query_, Glan-y-Gors?) lies near Bodwrdda and Ffynnon Ddurdan, described in _Arch. Camb._, First series, iv, p. 208, and is near the former of these two lines of road.'

This discussion in largely repeated verbatim in Westwood/1876, 177.

Nash-Williams appears to see a contradiction in the accounts of Westwood and Lewis, but there seems to be no reason for this (Nash-Williams/1936, 72).

Anon/1926, 444: `They had come from the site of the old chapel of Anelog, near Aberdaron, which Lewis called Capel y Verach;  he would hesitate greatly to connect this last name with the Veracius of the stone, which in modern Welsh would yield something quite different.  On the other hand, he had the authority of Sir John Morris Jones for associating Senacus and Bryn Hynog, a name found in the locality [about 1 mile N.W.W. of Pwllheli].

`Mr Hemp quoted a note made by the late Col. Wynne Finch and dated April 2, 1899, in which he said...`some ten years ago I went over [the farm called ``Gors''] and looked carefully for any stones like these, and inquired from the tenant but he knew of none nor could I see any likely stones.  When these stones were first brought here, I remember them well, and also remember hearing that there were other stones then on the spot with inscriptions on them, but that the others were all either broken or so defaced that these two were the only stones worth bringing away.''

`Mr Edward Owen, F.S.A., said that in one of the British Museum MSS. are a number of sketches and rough drawings made by or for Edward Lhuyd (d. 1709)...The really important information given in Lhuyd's sketch consists of the remark that the stones were then `At Kappell Yverach in Aberdaron parish in Llin.'  This is no doubt intended for Capel y Verach, and the chapel is one of those that are known to have stood near Aberdaron (as the jumping-off place for Bardsey), and was probably the foundation of the Veracius who is commemorated on the first of the inscribed stones.'

Macalister/1928, 306--307: `...it is noteworthy that Lewis Morris has left a note to the effect that in his time the stone lay in a place called Capel Berach...The other stone commemorates another presbyter, Senacus, who has appareantly given his name to a local hill, Bryn Hynog; he is said in his epitaph to lie there `with a multitude of his brethren.'  We can hardly fail to see in this, the record of an otherwise unrecorded massacre'.

RCAHMW/1964, 3, no. 1460: `Capel Anelog.

The total area is nearly 450 acres.  The Island is dominated by Mynydd Enlli (summit 500 ft. above O.D.) which falls precipitously to the sea on the E. The remainder of the surface is nearly flat, and is good agricultural land, but the S. part is very exposed...A survey by Whitchurch made in 1790, although drawn to a small scale shows about 12 dwellings at the foot of the W. slope of the mountain near the 130 ft. contour; of these only Carreg-bach (at SH 11982202) survives.  A large building apparently about 150 ft. E. of Hen-dy (at SH 12052223) is noted as `ruins of church barn etc.'; it has left no trace.  In 1806 it is recorded that there were 12 to 15 houses occupied by about 60 people mainly dependent on fishing; in 1960 there were seven permanent residents.  Between 1870 and 1875 the farms were rebuilt and form an interesting example of 19th-century agricultural planning.  Carreg and Plas-bach formed separate units, but the remaining eight were built as semi-detached houses, each pair with out-buildings set around a shared yard...The island was an important place of pilgrimage and monastic settlement throughout the Middle Ages, possibly from as early as the 6th century, but apart from a ruined tower belonging to the monastery (No. 1518) little remains visible except a few loose pieces of dressed stone, a fragmentary inscribed cross-slab and a medieval gravestone.  Some of the huts of which traces remain on Mynydd Enlli (No. 1520) may have formed part of the early monastic settlement, but no certain attribution can be made on the evidence of their present appearance...

`The Abbey of Enlli or St. Mary of Bardsey stood at about 150 ft. above O.D. at the N. end of the Island.  The tower within the present burial-ground is the only part of its structure remaining above ground.'

The tower dates from the 13th century constructed of rubble with local sandstone dressings.  It is 19 ft. square and 23 ft. high (RCAHMW/1964, 18). This ruined tower is the only surviving remains of the Abbey."|"RCAHMW/1964, 17--18: `The Island was famous in Wales by the early 12th century as a monastic retreat and a place of pilgrimage, being the reputed burial-place of such 6th-century saints as Dubricius (Dyfrig) and Deniol `of the Bangors'.  The earliest contemporary reference, however, appears to be in 1011, the _obit_ of a monk of Enlli, of about the same period as a fragmentary cross-slab found there...The church of Enlli is named among those leading churches of Gwynedd to which Gruffydd ap Cynan made gifts shortly before his death in 1137.  The monks are described as Culdees in 1188, like those of Beddgelert...; that is to say, they were still Celtic, not attached to any Roman monastic order.  But shortly before 1212 two canons of Bardsey appear as witnesses to a charter in favour of the Augustinian abbey of Haughmond (Salop) and its church at Nyfyn (No. 1680), a context which suggests that they were already canons of the same rule.  Such a change is reflected in 1252 in an agreement between the abbey of Enlli and the secular canons of Aberdaron (No. 1456).  Its terms imply a previous connection between the two bodies, and this reappears in the 16th century.  The abbey certainly belonged to the Augustinian Order from the early 14th century until the Dissolution.

`No direct record of building is known, but _ca._ 1305 the abbey was provisionally allowed to take timber from the woods of Merioneth.  In 1346 the abbot and the canons were able to shut themselves up when the Island was raided.  As granted after the Dissolution the site contained the `monastery of small priorie' with `the church hows & steple', as well as rooms and barns, orchards and gardens.

`No demolition is recorded then; the buildings must have been left to fall into ruin.  In 1662, John Ray the naturalist noted a ruined church, adding,`three more they told us of'.  Pennant in 1773 writes of `the abbot's house...a larges stone building inhabited by several of the natives' and `not far from it...a singular chapel, or oratory, being a long arched edifice, with an insulated stone altar near the east end'.  The abbot's lodging was still inhabited in 1814, but by 1846 only the ruined tower remained.'"|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL

Ferguson points to the fact that Rathfran ""was undoubtedly a residence of Amalgaid, or Awley, the cotemporary of Patrick, from whom the barony takes its name, and in Foghill we probably have some trace, in its northern limits, of that wood of Fochlaidh, celebrated in all lives of the saint"".

TS/1862, 134, `There is a kistvaen in this neighbourhood still in good preservation.  The kist measures four feet by two feet six inches.  The top stone measures six feet six inches by four feet ten inches.  This was opened by Lhuyd, and found to contain an urn with ashes of burnt bones, as appears from his additions to Camden's _Britannia_ (Gough's ed.) iii, 127._

Westwood/1879, 2--3, `On a mountain near Kevn Gelhi Gaer, not far from Caerphilly on the way to Marchnad y Wayn, stands a maen-hir with an inscription given by E. Lhwyd in Gibson's Camden, p. 616, and in Gough's Camden (ii. p. 498, and ed. alt. iii. p. 127), represented as it appeared in 1693, and as copied in my Plate. After leaving Merthyr Tydvil and passing through Dowlais two great ponds are arrived at, a little east of the third mile-stone from Merthyr Tydvil on the way to Abergavenny. The cart-road to Gelhi Gaer runs southward from this spot, passing to the east side of a farm about half a mile from the Abergavenny-road, then winds round another mountain to the south, with several small farm-houses on its eastern slope, into the valley, and the maen-hir is seen standing very conspicuously about a furlong to the west of the road, about three miles and a half from the Abergavenny-road ... 

`In the letters of E. Lhwyd, preserved in the Bodleian Library, Oxford, is one dated October 10, 1693, in which this inscription is copied, and it is further stated that `close under this stone there's a small round [represented as oval] trench about 6 yards over, with a square area, &c., within it. My thoughts are that in ye area in ye midst, a man lies buried ... 

`In Mr. Lukis's Memoir on the Cromlechs, &c., near Cardiff (Arch. Camb., 1875, p. 183), this maen-hir is mentioned as standing on the south edge of a small double circular embankment, or a circle within a circle, 33 feet in diameter'.

Macalister/1949, 153, `Certain cist graves in the neighbourhood (illustrated 1875, 1879) do not appear to have any essential connexion with the inscription.'

Fox/1939, 34--35, `This stone, with its defaced inscription, stands on the east side of Gelligaer Common above the valley of the Bargoed Rhymney at the head of which is the colliery village of Fochriw.  The long moorland ridge rises slowly and steadily northwards from Gelligaer village and reaches a well-defined summit at Carn Bugail (1,570 ft.) a little to the north-west of the stone.  Thereafter the ridge slowly rises again till it joins the main tableland of south Breconshire and north-west Monmouthshire.  Cairns and finds on the ridge are evidence of prehistoric occupation and indicate the use of a traffic way down its spine.  At its south end was the Roman fort of Gelligaer, on the outskirts of the present village, and the modern road northwards, _Heol Adam_, is thought to coincide in parts with the Roman route to a settlement at Penydarren, Merthyr Tydfil, which proceeds over the Beacons to the fort at Brecon.

`For some three miles up the spur, the metalled road keeps a direct course along the crest of the ridge and no doubt represents the approximate Roman line; the narrowing of the ridge at intervals, as near Tyla-glas Farm, precludes any great error.  North of B.M. 1255.2, this line coincides intermittently with several grass tracks, none of which shows any sign of Roman construction.  Beyond the Bedlinog-Fochriw road, the same alignment brings the road to the eastern side of the ridge, crossing the portion of the plateau on which the stone is standing and thereby avoiding the top of the Carn Bugail.  It is impossible without excavation to fix the exact course of the road at this point, but since the plateau on this side only extends laterally for 400--500 yards, we are justified in thinking that the stone stood in full view of, and probably close to, the Roman road.

`Approached from Gelligaer, the site is inconspicuous, but from the north the stone surprisingly appears on the skyline.  The position again has been carefully chosen on a slight shoulder and, I suggest, near the highest point traversed by the Roman road.  The inscription is on the north-east angle of the stone, and is designed therefore to be read from the eastern side.

`Former observers have recorded that this stone stands at the edge of a small enclosure, of which various plans have been given.  It consists to-day of a low earthen horseshoe-shaped bank, measuring 35 ft. in diameter overall, with the stone in the gap at its south-eastern base.  The material for the bank seems to have been partly dug from a small internal ditch, in which the pole in the photograph (Pl. I (b)) is set up.  The area so enclosed (16 ft. 9 in. in diameter) has been extensively dug over, no doubt by the same band of miners who are alleged to have mutilated the insc"|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL

The ruins of an old church, measuring fifty-two feet by eighteen feet ten inches in the clear, occupy a place in the original churchyard, and the only monument found here was a tomb bearing the following inscription.  From the silence concerning Kilconriola in the early authorities, Dr. Reeves was disposed to regard the church and churchyard as possessing no great claim to antiquity...The discovery, however, of the inscribed stone described below proves that the cemetery is a very ancient one.

`The site is on a small promontory with cliffs rising some fifty feet above sea level immediately to the east of a small cove with a shingle beach marked Stage Cove on the 6"" map.  Across the neck of the headland the remains of a bank and ditch can be seen.  Continuing out from the headland and cut off from it and from each other by narrow channels are two tiny grass-topped islands or stacks marked as Gully's Island on the map.  These probably formed part of the interior of the fort originally but have been separated from it by the sea.

`At a point where the headland measures 35m across it is defended by a sinlge bank and ditch.  These have been badly damaged by cultivation and survive best at each end under and outside the cliff-top field fence.  In its damaged state the ditch appears to be some 8m wide and at the bank,  which is c. 6m wide, rises 1.20m above the bottom of the ditch.  No entrance is at present discernable.  The area within the bank is at present only 20m long but if the two islands were once part of the interior it would have measured at least 90m.

`The cliffs of the Waterford coast present many suitable locations for promontory forts and known  examples have been published by Westropp as part of his pioneering and as yet unsurpassed study of this monument type in Ireland.  The Knockmahon fort with its single bank and ditch would conform to Westropp's type (a).  It is overlooked by gradually rising ground to the north and by higher cliffs to the east so that its position commanding Stage Cove, where boats could be beached, may have been the main reason for locating the fort here.  It should also be noted that the immediate surrounding area has rich copper ore deposits which were mined in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries and probably earlier because the exposed veins of ore in the cliffs would have been easy to detect and mine.'"|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL

Halliday/1900 provides an extensive description of the present church.

Halliday/1903 provides an account of the moving of the Illtud stone [LTWIT/2] and the archaeological remains associated with it including a cist grave.

Anon/1913, 89--90, `Llantwit Major is remarkable for a striking series of buildings, which, lying in a deep valley below the town, presents a minature representation of the grand group of St. David's.  The strange elongated pile of the church (itself a remarkable accumulation of distinct buildings) is flanked towards the south by the remains of the thirteenth century Gate-house, and a wall a few feet high forms a boundary fence.  The great tithe-barn of the same period, mentioned in earlier accounts, was pulled down some years ago.

`The church occupies the site of one of the earliest Christian foundations in Wales.  A great monastic institution of the early British type, at once the headquaters of missionary effort and the seat of a democratic university, grew up here in the early part of the sixth century.  No trace of this early timber-built monastery now exists.

`The architectural peculiarities of the church, characterised by its extraordinary length with a singularly short nave, for a long time puzzled archaeologists, including Freeman, J. H. Parker &c., a special puzzle being the long extent of the building west of the present nave, and particularly the erection at the extreme west end.  Was it domestic or ecclesiastical?

`The following briefly represents the interpretation now generally accepted, to which the restoration in 1900 under Mr. G. E. Halliday's able direction has materially contributed.  The visitors were fortunate in having Mr. G. E. Halliday and the Vicar, Rev. H. Morris as guides:---

`The present church consists of three distinct parts : (1) a chancel, a nave, north and south aisles, and a tower inserted in the west end; (2) a Western church, known locally as the ``Old Church,'' with an unusually large south porch and parvise; and (3) further west, but now ruinous, the Ragland chantry, with a sacristan's lodging attached on the north side.

`Before this restoration of 1900 it was maintained on architectural grounds against local tradition that the Eastern church was the earliest portion, and that the Western church was wrongly called the ``Old Church.'' Mr Halliday, on the ground of discoveries made in 1900, proves that the tradition was not entirely erroneous.

`1. The inner door of the south porch of the Western church is the oldest part of the present building, being, in fact, the south door of a pre-Norman nave, and the lower tiers of the masonry of this part being probably portions of the pre-Norman church, built on a cruciform plan with transepts.

`2. To this was added, at the very beginning of the 13th century, a central tower.

`3. The chancel of this early church, later in that century, was removed to make room for a conventual church, the Norman transepts were extended eastwards to form a north aisle and a south aisle (reaching two bays further than  present), while the early nave was elongated westward.

`4. Late in the fourteenth century the two eastern bays of the south arcade were built up, a chancel arch with its two squints inserted.

`5.  In the fifteenth century the Western, or ``Old Church'' (but not the so-called ``Lady Chapel'' at the extreme west) was entirely rebuilt on the old foundations from about two feet above the ground-line.

`At the east end of the south aisle of the Eastern church is a niche of the early thirteenth century, a perfect example of the work of that period.  It is not _in situ_, having been moved several times.  It is now set into and partly projects from the wall.  On each side of the niche is a vine, climbing up and twisting round the heads of 14 crowned personages, seven on each side, some with beards, others without; and at the central point of the highest portion is the head of the Saviour, with the crossed nimbus, bearded.

Island of Lundy is in the Bristol Channel  16 miles from Ilfracombe.  It is 3 miles long (N-S) and 0.5 miles wide (E-W).  It is isolated but highly visible rising to 463 mOD.

There was, by the 13th century, a church dedicated to St Helen or Helena which by the 16th c. was under the aegis of Cleeve Abbey.  A `much battered granite cell', 14 by 25 feet is still visible.  

The present walled graveyard was used until recently, with graves being dug within and without the church.  The modern dry-stone wall was built by Trinity House, but overlies an earlier enclosure thought by Thomas to be an early medieval lann.  This is still visible to the SW of the enclosure.

Traces of two celtic field systems survive on the Island, one partly underlying the cemetery."|"Cemetary partly excavated in 1961 by K. S. Gardner and A. Langham.

Island bought by National Trust in 1968.

Site further excavated by A. C. Thomas in 1969.  The following account is taken by from Thomas/1994, chapter 10.

Excavation showed that the early cemetary had at least 100 long cist graves of early Christian character. Some were small as if for children.  Re-examination of archive by ACT in 1990 revealed five phases:

1. Roman-British circular hut---now largely destroyed but traces remain; pattern re-inforced by finds.

2. Hut walls destroyed to create a rectangular enclosure 11' N--S by 7--8' E--W within which a cist grave was constructed aligned E--W.  The whole was then filled with granite pebbles to a depth of 3'.  The whole forms a special grave, perhaps a 'cella memoriae' (cell of a grave monument).  Two other burials to the west, also in cists made from the original Romano-British hut may be contemporary.

3. 50--100 years later, the 'cella' was broken open.  The largest slab on the southern edge was swung through 90 degrees and the granite pebbles removed.  The lid of the cist was then removed and the bones taken away.  Thomas believes this to be a `translatio' (removal of a saints bones).

4. Further graves dug near the cella.

5. Still more graves dug near the cella.

ACT interprets the main feature in phase 2 as being a burial of an important christian figure in an existing burial ground.  The bones were then removed as relics.  ACT believes the island was the home of small ecclesiastical community which came into being by  AD 480--500.  Lundy's absence in the later record is perhaps because in ceased to function as a religious house in the 7th century."|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL

It [the stone] stood near a small tumulus or hillock called in Welsh `Crug Diwlith,' or the Dewless, the little mound where the bards of Tir Jarrl were accustomed to meet on the morning of the 24th of June, and was, when I visited it, lying amongst the stones still remaining of this tumulus. From the observation which I made of the locality it seemed to me that the situation had been chosen with reference to the origin of the river Kenfig, as the rise of this little stream can be traced to a small morass close to the tumulus on which the stone was lying.'

Aileen and Cyril Fox provide an extensive discussion of the area around the stone and the settlements found there (Fox/Fox/1934).

Fox/1939, 36--37: `This stone stood on the top of Margam Mountain, an extensive outlier of the Glamorgan uplands overlooking the coastal flats but linked with the hinterland to the north by a narrow saddle of high land.  A well defined trackway (_British Trackway_ on O.S. maps) indicates the route to the north.  The Bodvoc stone is set up beside this road at its highest point where it crosses the mountain at the source of the river Kenfig.  A small portion of the plateau to the south and east appears to have been a centre of settlement in early times---it contains the remains of three fortified enclosures, Y Bwlwarcau, Rhyd Blaen-y-cwm and Gaer Cwm Philip, which for reasons which have been given elsewhere are probably of post-Roman date.  Ascending the trackway from Rhyd Blaen-y-Cwm up the left bank of the Kenfig, the Bodvoc stone dominates the skyline for the greater part of the way.  Approached from any other direction it is hard to find, as it lies in a small hollow on the crest.  It is clear that the site was chosen by settlers on the south, to whom the roadway to the north was of importance.

`The stone stands 25 yards away from the eastern edge of the present track; it is in the middle of a small enclosure, which, unfortunately, was mutilated in the middle of the nineteenth century.  Enough remains, I think, in the light of Fochriw, to show its original character.  There are the remains of a low circular bank with indications of a ditch inside, measuring 33 feet in diameter, north to south.  On the west side, facing the road, both bank and ditch have gone.  The enclosed area has a rectangular appearance, and measures some 8 ft. square; the stone, unlike Fochriw, however, is set up in the middle of the `area.' It is important to notice that the inscription, like that on Maen Madoc, is on the south face, the face that is visible from the uphill approach from the presumed settlement area.'"|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL|NULL

If the description given in the MSS. be correct, we must look for the chapel on the other side of the river; the site of the stones under consideration and `Platch yr Eglwys,' not far away, offer themselves as possible solutions.

During the twelfth century the grange of Llangewydd, about a mile west of the find spot, was given to the Abbey (Birch, p. 24), and this gift was followed early in the thirteenth by several local grants made by Morgan ap Caradoc or his free tenants. Three of these grants are relevant:

`(1) A grant by Roger Cole (famulus of Morgan ap Caradoc) of land of his free tenement at Newcastle, having on the west the stream called Ellenepullelake and reaching east to Witherel. on the north the boundaries of the land of Coithcart and on the south cultivated land which leads down to the high road of Newcastle, to be taken as 4 acres. (Birch, p. 156; Cartae, CCCC).

`(2) A grant of 1205 by Morgan son of Caradoc of land at Newcastle, of land and meadow comprised between the land which the monks hold of Pagan de Turberwile, along the stream called Witherel to the Grenewei highroad, and then to Scurlage's land called Crokerehille. (Birch, p. 160; Cartae, CCXCV).

`(3) A grant by Morgan son of Caradoc of all the land he holds between the Witherel and Ellenepulle lake. (Cartae, CCCCIJI).

There is in addition a general confirmation by Earl Richard de Clare (1229_61) of the gift, among his `other lands of Glamorgan, of all land between Crokkereshille and Ellenewellelake, and between the latter and Wytherel, comprising 37 acres. (Cartae, CCCCLXVI). 

`Professor William Rees identifies `Witherel' with the stream marked as `_Nantcefn-glas_' on the Ordnance Survey sheet (South Wales and the Border in the 14th century, SE. sheet). This rises about 200 yds. south-east of the spot where the stone was found. The name `Crokereshille' probably relates to an area in the vicinity of three fields that retained the name `Cae Cocker Hill' as late as the mid-nineteenth century, when they appear as such in the Tithe apportionment.[3] It seems likely, therefore, that the stone may have marked the north-east corner of an area bounded on the east by the Witherel brook.

`Its style rules out the possibility that the stone was carved for this purpose in the thirteenth century. This might imply that its original site was elsewhere, and that it was re-used as a boundary stone at the spot on which it was found. If this is so, it is not possible to say what its original site or its original function might have been, as stones of this type, with panels for inscriptions below the crosses, can be memorials or commemorate grants of land (cf. ECMW, no. 240). On the other hand, it is possible that the land to which it relates might previously have belonged to the Church. In this connection its proximity to the site of Llangewydd church should be noted, and also that the donor Roger Cole is described in the charter as `famulus' (i.e. priest) of Morgan ap Caradoc.

The site on a west facing slope above an alluvial valley, is `typical' of such contexts for `rounds' in West Cornwall. It is now identified by the gentle curving of the churchyard wall to the north and west of the church. This was rebuilt in 1793 in conjunction with the enlarging of the churchyard to the west and south. It was probably then that the oval, or circular, shaped of the _lan_ was destroyed.

In 1680 some tin miners looking for treasure dug around the stone and found underground `a spacious vault'.  After this the stone fell into the pit.  Okasha then notes Spence's account mentioned by Macalister (above).  Further excavation took place in 1932 by Andrew who stated that this underground `chapel' was in fact `made by men who came to search for treasure and stayed a while to prospect for tin'.

T. Williams of Tir-y-Cwm, Ystrad, near Swansea, for the following account of the locality mentioned by Gough:

` ``The Sarn Helen, or Sarn y Lleng, is the military road that joins Neath to Chester. It traverses a long ridge which commences about three miles from Neath; and ceases to be a ridge about seven miles further, close behind Aberpergwm, that is, to the north of the Vale of Neath. The road is as plainly evident all along this ridge as any parish road. In many places flagstones are seen, and the kerbstones by the side. The farm where the road emerges from the valley, or enclosed land, is called Letty-rafel, i.e., Letty Travaelwr, _Anglicè_ Traveller's Rest. This ridge is called Cefn Hir fynydd; in some maps, Hir fynydd. At the extremity of the ridge, where it leaves the mountain, it turns sharp to the north, almost at right angles, so as to cross the Banwan valley at the easiest place. The whole valley is a `banwan,' or boggy place, abounding with snipes, plovers, and occasionally bitterns. At this angle there are gates, as the mountain here becomes enclosed land; and within the enclosure there are _two tumuli_, about six or seven yards in diameter. On the larger one was this stone; whether upright or horizontal, I know not.' [The term `pillar' applied to it by Gough would imply the former.] `These are considered as fairy rings by the peasantry. After descending a very wet and steep side of a hill, where extra pains appear to have been had recourse to, to elevate the causeway above the adjacent ground, on the flat beneath is an old thatched house, known from the olden time by the name of the Tavern y Banwan. A farmhouse is called Tonyfildre (Ton-yr-efil-dre), `the smithy of the town'; another, where there are evident remains of an encampment, is called Ton-y-castell, `the castle hill'; and a small farm is called Y Disgwylfa, _i.e._, `the look-out,' or the outpost. Further than this I have not traced the road; but I have seen it in its onward course, here and there, on the mountains. As Ton-y-castell and these small hilly farms all lie close together, about twelve or thirteen miles from Neath, I presume here a regiment would halt on the first night, between this and the Gaer, in the Vale of Usk, about fifteen miles, the next day's march.

`I do not perceive that any attempt was made during the Society's Meeting at Brecon to trace this road. I think I have seen traces of it on the Eppynt mountains; and about fifteen miles from the Gaer on the Eppynt there are three large tumuli, where the army might have encamped for the night. The next place I have met with it is on Llandrindod Common, leading to the perfect and beautifully situated encampment called Cwm. Here there are the remains of a large walled encampment with massive walls, and the river Ithon defends it on two sides. I have heard that some years back the ovens were seen. This would be about half way from Neath to Chester. On the Common are several campi aestivi.'' '

Fox/1939, 32--34: `This stone formerly stood near the point marked _Clwydi Banwen_ at the top of a steep foothill of the Hirfynydd ridge, overlooking the extensive marsh of Banwen Pyrddin.[3a] About a mile northwards as the crow flies, the Sarn Helen leaves the south gate of Coelbren fort pointing straight towards this hill; its course through the new colliery village of Tirbach is marked on the 6-in. O.S. maps and it formerly existed as a raised causeway.[4] The straight alignment continued part of the way up the steep slope ; pieces of the road are still visible beneath tips and mine workings. Past Tyn-yr-heol the track curves a little round the side of the hill, making for the Clwydi Banwen saddle. From here to the top it becomes a regular pack-horse track, consisting of several hollow-ways, and all trace of Roman construction is thereby obliterated; nevertheless, I think the probabilities are in favour of the close approximation of this track to the Roman line.[1a] At Clwydi Banwen the track passes through a gate in the stone wall and then turns at right angles to begin the ascent of the Hirfynydd ridge proper. The stone is recorded to have stood `within the enclosed land,' i.e. on the Coelbren side of the gate, a spot now much disturbed by old workings.

`The stone, then, like Maen Madoc was set up beside an existing Roman road, in a place where there is every likelihood of it being crest sited from the northern approach. The position must have been selected by people living in the Coelbren area or the adjacent foothills, not on the high moorland; descending from Hirfynydd the site is inconspicuous.

`There is good evidence that originally it stood on a small barrow or `intrenchment.'

Fox/1939, 35--36: `Cefn Brithdir is the adjoining ridge to Cefn Gelligaer, and forms the eastern side of the Bargoed-Rhymney valley.  The Tegernacus stone stood on the top of the ridge, in a field to the north-west of the little church known as Capel Brithdir, and to the west of the roadway that runs along the spur.  This roadway is  a true ridgeway, traversing the hill from end to end, and affords an easy passage round the head of the valley, where it joins the Roman road from Gelligaer near Rhaslas pond... The site of the stone (now by with a concrete pillar) like the others discussed, is, therefore, likely to have been selected for its proximity to a traffic route.

`Owing to the numerous high dry-stone field walls which surround it, it is impossible to determine whether the stone was crest-sited.  There are no remains of any surrounding earthwork or other distinguishing feature beside it; the field has been under plough in the past.'

Radio-carbon dates, and especially large quantities of imported Mediterranean pottery and glass can be used to date occupation of the Island from the fifth to the seventh century. The finding of Oxford Red Colour-coated ware, and of two Late Roman period milestones argue for the possibility that some sort of occupation began on the Island in the fourth century.
